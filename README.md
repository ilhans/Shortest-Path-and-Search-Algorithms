# Shortest-Path-and-Search-Algorithms


**Project**

In this project shortest path algorithms and search algorithms **( Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra, Nearest Neighbour, Hill Climbing, Best First Search, A\*, Iterative Deepening )**was implemented for given 21 cities **(Izmir, Cesme, Antalya, Canakkale, BalÄ±kesir, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Istanbul, Alexandroupoli, Kesan, Kardzali, Serres, Thessaloniki, Sofia, Haskovo, Athens, Skopje, Bucharest, Ankara, Kusadasi )**.

1.Select Start City

2.Select Destination City

3. Select algorithm which you would like to run.

4.Algorithms can run according to driving distance (KM) or driving time (minutes).

5. There is also city excluding option in the program. You can remove city from city set. There is example shown below. Bellman-Ford runs without excluding city from &quot;Izmir&quot; to &quot;Bucharest&quot;.

6. There is example that &quot;Edirne&quot; excluded shown below. Bellman-Ford runs  from &quot;Izmir&quot; to &quot;Bucharest&quot;. Difference can be seen in Route ,Map  and Distance fields. Exclude city options can be used for any algorithms.

**Requirements**

Project uses Google Maps Javascript libraries and JXBrowser Framework to work. In order to be error - free JXBrowser licence.jar, jxbrowser-6.19.1.jar , jxbrowser-win32-6.19.1.jar must be provided as a library.

JxBrowser is a cross-platform Java library that allows integrating Google Chromium-based web browser component into your Java Swing/AWT/JavaFX application. With JxBrowser you can embed a lightweight Swing/JavaFX component into your Java application to display modern web pages, supporting the latest web standards such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript etc.
